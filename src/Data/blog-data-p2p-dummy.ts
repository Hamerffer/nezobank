  <section class="p-6">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 paragraph-variable">How It Works</h2>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 paragraph-variable text-base">
    <li class="text-lg">
      <strong>Browse Ads:</strong> Use filters to select offers based on amount, price, and supported payment methods. This ensures you find the most reliable deal that matches your trading needs securely and efficiently.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      <strong>Place Order:</strong> After selecting an ad, the seller’s cryptocurrency immediately locks into secure escrow. This prevents fraud while you confidently make your agreed payment without exposure or unnecessary risks.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      <strong>Confirm Payment:</strong> Once funds are transferred, mark your transaction as paid in-platform and upload relevant proof if required. This strengthens seller trust and speeds up release confirmations reliably.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      <strong>Release:</strong> When the seller verifies payment receipt, the escrow system instantly releases cryptocurrency to your wallet, making the trade transparent, fair, and safely completed in full compliance.
    </li>
  </ol>

<section class="p-6">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 paragraph-variable">Why Use P2P?</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 paragraph-variable text-base">
    <li class="text-lg">
      P2P lowers transaction costs compared to cards or exchange purchases. Without high processing or trading fees, you retain more value from each trade with improved overall margins as a buyer.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      Enjoy flexible payments such as local transfers, prepaid balances, digital wallets, or vouchers. These options make buying or selling assets seamless, especially where cross-border settlements can otherwise be difficult.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      In markets with limited on-ramps, P2P provides safe and practical alternatives. It uses reliable escrow with community-verified sellers, enabling consistent and trustworthy access to digital assets anywhere globally.
    </li>
  </ul>

<section class="p-6">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 paragraph-variable">Best Practices</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 paragraph-variable text-base">
    <li class="text-lg">
      Keep every conversation and transaction inside the platform; private chats remove escrow protections, exposing you to potential fraud or disputes where support won’t be able to assist effectively.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      Always verify funds have cleared and are available in your personal account before releasing assets. This ensures your payments are final, preventing reversals and keeping your holdings safe and secure.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      For disputes, use only in-platform messaging systems. Official channels provide records that are reviewable by support, allowing faster, fairer resolution if a disagreement or suspicious problem arises during trading.
    </li>
  </ul>

<section class="p-6">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 paragraph-variable">FAQ</h2>
  <p class="paragraph-variable text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
    <strong>How long does a trade take?</strong> Most P2P exchanges complete within 5–15 minutes depending on seller quickness and your payment option. However, delays may occur during slow banking hours or weekends.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph-variable text-lg leading-relaxed">
    <strong>What if the seller doesn’t release?</strong> If funds are delayed or withheld, immediately open an appeal within the app. Escrow protects you, ensuring your crypto only releases with impartial support intervention.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 paragraph-variable">Common Scams</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 paragraph-variable text-base">
    <li class="text-lg">
      <strong>Off-platform payment:</strong> Fraudsters may pressure you into moving communication or payments to WhatsApp, Telegram, or other private channels, which eliminates escrow safety and exposes you to untraceable financial losses.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      <strong>Fake receipts:</strong> Scammers often fabricate convincing screenshots or altered bank receipts, but unless real funds deposit into your account balance, no actual transfer has truly taken place.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      <strong>Chargebacks:</strong> Reversible payment methods such as credit cards or PayPal enable dishonest actors to dispute a completed transaction, so always confirm trades only through secure, platform-approved rails.
    </li>
  </ul>

<section class="p-6">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 paragraph-variable">Safety Checklist</h2>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 paragraph-variable text-base">
    <li class="text-lg">
      Always trade with <strong>verified</strong> and reputable counterparties who consistently maintain strong ratings, since unreliable profiles drastically increase your risks of fraud or incomplete settlement issues.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      Keep all chats, negotiations, and transfer instructions strictly <strong>inside the platform</strong>, ensuring escrow protection works correctly and maintains visible logs for support to step in if disputes occur.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      Only release crypto <strong>after</strong> confirmed funds settle securely inside your own bank or wallet account, preventing losses from deceptive screenshots or delayed interbank settlement processes that appear misleading.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      Always transact using payment accounts registered in <strong>your own name</strong>, because mismatched ownership details can invalidate appeals, complicate verification, and significantly weaken your safeguard protections during conflict escalation.
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section class="p-6">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 paragraph-variable">If Something Goes Wrong</h2>
  <p class="paragraph-variable text-lg leading-relaxed">
    Do not release cryptocurrency under pressure. Instead, open an immediate <strong>appeal</strong> within the trading platform, attaching strong evidence such as clear bank statements, transfer reference IDs, 
    transaction proofs, and in-app chats to assist the support team during resolution.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="p-6">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 paragraph-variable">Quick Tips</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 paragraph-variable text-base">
    <li class="text-lg">
      Always treat listings significantly below market value as bait, since such offers are often scams designed to attract risk-takers and exploit unsuspecting buyers seeking quick profits.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      Never share OTPs, two-factor authentication codes, or passwords, because giving away authorization codes enables attackers to hijack your account instantly, freezing your balance and draining assets quickly.
    </li>
    <li class="text-lg">
      Block and report any suspicious users displaying unusual patterns or requests, helping the platform community remain safe while preventing malicious actors from repeating scams on new traders elsewhere.
